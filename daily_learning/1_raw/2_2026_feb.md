# How to reduce dependency on generative tools for getting answers
 
 ## * always take time to think yourself before asking .
 ## * instead of asking "What should i do?" ask "I am doing or thinking this what am i missing ?", tell: i choose option x for this reasn does this make sense(just explain why you choose something).
 ## * use AI like a reviewer not a decison maker.
 
## When it’s OK to depend 
   * Understanding concepts

   * Getting unstuck after trying

   * Reviewing your logic

   * Learning industry standards

   * Speeding up repetitive stuff

   * This is smart use, not dependency.

## When it’s NOT OK (red zone)

   * Be careful if you:

   * Ask immediately without thinking

   * Ask for every small choice

   * Feel anxious making decisions alone

   * Avoid confusion instead of sitting with it

    Confusion is where learning happens. Avoiding it = stagnation.

## A simple rule to follow daily
The 70–30 rule

   * 70% decisions → you decide

   * 30% → you verify with me

   * If you can explain why you chose something, you’re good — even if it’s not optimal.
