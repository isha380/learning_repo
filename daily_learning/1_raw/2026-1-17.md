1. What SQLAlchemy Is

SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) used to interact with relational databases.

It allows developers to write database logic using Python classes instead of raw SQL queries.

SQLAlchemy supports multiple databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

It provides two main layers: Core (SQL expression language) and ORM (object mapping layer).

SQLAlchemy abstracts database-specific syntax while still allowing full SQL control.

It helps maintain clean separation between business logic and database logic.

SQLAlchemy improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

It manages database connections efficiently using connection pooling.

It prevents common SQL injection vulnerabilities when used correctly.

SQLAlchemy is widely used in Flask and FastAPI backend systems.

2. SQLAlchemy Core vs ORM

SQLAlchemy Core uses SQL expression language to write queries programmatically.

Core focuses on tables, columns, and SQL statements instead of Python objects.

ORM maps database tables to Python classes called models.

ORM allows developers to work with database rows as Python objects.

Core gives more control and is closer to raw SQL behavior.

ORM provides higher abstraction and faster development.

Core is preferred for complex or performance-critical queries.

ORM is preferred for CRUD-heavy applications.

ORM internally uses Core to execute SQL queries.

Both Core and ORM can be used together in the same project.

# A cursor is an object that allows your Python code to send SQL commands to PostgreSQL and receive results.

we need a cursor because:

-PostgreSQL does not understand Python
-PostgreSQL understands SQL
-Cursor acts as a translator between Python and SQL

# In Python, every file (called a "module") gets a special hidden variable
