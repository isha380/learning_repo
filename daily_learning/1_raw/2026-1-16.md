👉What kind of algorithm is HS256?

# HS256 = HMAC + SHA-256

That means:

HMAC → a way to sign data using a secret key

SHA-256 → a hashing algorithm

So HS256 is a cryptographic signing algorithm.

-Its job is NOT to encrypt data
-Its job is to prove the data is authentic and unchanged

# While verifying if the logged in users' role is admin or not:

## HS256 is a lock 

-Backend creates the token using a secret key
-HS256 is the method used to lock and unlock the token
-If someone changes even 1 letter, verification fails

## Without HS256:
-Anyone could fake a token and say:

{ "role": "admin" }

## With HS256:
Backend can detect -->

-Fake token
-Modified token
-Expired token

# HS256 is the security method that lets your backend trust the data inside a JWT and safely decide whether the user is an admin or not.
