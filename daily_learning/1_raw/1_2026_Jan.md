How to read books **fast** 

So the goal is **not speed-reading**.
The goal is **high-leverage reading**.

> One page that changes behavior > 100 pages remembered vaguely

---

## The Core Rule (burn this into mind)

📌 **Read for INSIGHT, not information**

Information = forgettable
Insight = changes how you see things

---

## Step 1: Before reading — set the “filter”

Never open a book casually.

Ask **ONE question** before starting:

> “What problem in my life am I reading this for?”

Examples:

* Overthinking
* Fear of failure
* Discipline
* Attachment to results
* Confusion about direction

📌 Your brain will now **automatically hunt for relevant insights**
Without this, everything feels important → nothing sticks.

---

## Step 2: How to read FAST without losing depth

### ❌ What people do

* Read every sentence equally
* Highlight everything
* Keep reading even when confused

### ✅ What action-takers do

#### Rule 1: **Skim → then slow**

* Skim the chapter first (2–3 minutes)
* Get the *direction*
* Then read properly

This prevents mental overload.

---

#### Rule 2: **Read in chunks, not lines**

* Read 1–2 pages
* STOP
* Ask:

  > “What is the ONE idea here?”

If you can’t answer, reread — don’t move forward.

---

#### Rule 3: Skip without guilt

Not every paragraph deserves your time.

📌 If it doesn’t hit your current problem → skip.

Books are not exams.

---

## Step 3: The “1 Insight Rule” (most powerful habit)

From **every reading session**, extract only:
👉 **ONE sentence insight**

Not 5. Not 10. ONE.

Example:

* “Attachment is not love; it’s fear of loss.”
* “Action with expectation poisons peace.”

Write it:

* In phone notes
* Or margin
* Or one notebook

📌 This is how you remember books **for years**.

---

## Step 4: Turn insight into action (THIS is where most fail)

Never ask:
❌ “What does this mean?”

Always ask:
✅ **“What will I DO differently today?”**

### Convert insight → micro-action

Example:
Insight: *“Do your duty without attachment to result.”*
Action:

* Study for 45 min without checking outcome
* No comparison today
* Focus only on effort

📌 If there’s no action, you didn’t really read — you consumed.

---

## Step 5: The 24-Hour Lock-In Rule

If you don’t use an insight within **24 hours**, it dies.

So after reading, ask:

> “Where will I apply this today or tomorrow?”

Tiny actions count.

---

## Step 6: How to remember lessons long-term

### Use this 3-layer memory system

#### 1️⃣ Revisit, don’t reread

* Re-read your **notes**, not the book
* Takes 2 minutes
* 10× retention

---

#### 2️⃣ Teach it (even silently)

Explain the idea:

* To yourself
* Or in your head
* Or write 3 lines as if teaching someone

If you can’t explain it simply → you didn’t get it.

---

#### 3️⃣ Connect it to pain

Insights stick when tied to:

* Past mistake
* Regret
* Fear
* Real experience

Your brain remembers **emotion**, not text.

---

## Step 7: Ideal daily reading system (realistic)

⏱️ **20–30 minutes max**

Structure:

* 5 min → skim
* 10–15 min → slow reading
* 5 min → write ONE insight
* 5 min → decide ONE action

That’s it.

This beats 2 hours of passive reading.

---

## Books like Gita / Krishnamurti — special warning ⚠️

These books:

* Are NOT meant to be “finished”
* Are meant to be **lived**

👉 Read slower than normal books
👉 Sometimes **1 page is enough for the day**

Rushing these books actually blocks insight.

---

## Final reality check

📌 Readers collect knowledge
📌 Action-takers collect **changed behavior**

If after a book:

* You think slightly differently
* You act slightly differently
* You react slightly less emotionally

Then the book worked.
