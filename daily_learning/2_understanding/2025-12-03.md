Today i learned about naming convention. As i was doing my project, i found that my folder structure was messy.So, what i did is ask chatgpt about the professional way to organize the file and i got some handy as well as useful tips.

Naming convention used by highly professional teams:
________________________________________
1. Components → PascalCase
Navbar.jsx
Footer.jsx
StatsCard.jsx
VolunteerCard.jsx
Because components are classes/objects.
________________________________________
2. Services/utility functions → camelCase
eventService.js
authService.js
dashboardService.js
formatNumber.js
dateUtils.js
Because they export functions, not components.
________________________________________
3. Pages (Next.js App Router) → use folder name + page.jsx
app/dashboard/page.jsx
app/login/page.jsx
app/register/page.jsx
Folders lowercase. Files lowercase.
Next.js doesn't use PascalCase for pages.
________________________________________
4. API Routes → route.js
app/api/events/route.js
app/api/auth/route.js
________________________________________
5. CSS Files → kebab-case (industry standard)
This is important.
Rename:
Old	New
NavBar.css	navbar.css
StatsCard.css	stats-card.css
Dashboard.css	dashboard.css
style.css	style.css (ok if global)
Because CSS is never PascalCase or camelCase.
